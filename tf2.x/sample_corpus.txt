# one sentence per line, with words (lower case) delimited by single space

with all this stuff going down at the moment with mj i 've started listening to his music , watching the odd documentary here and there , watched the wiz and watched moonwalker again .
maybe i just want to get a certain insight into this guy who i thought was really cool in the eighties just to maybe make up my mind whether he is guilty or innocent .
moonwalker is part biography , part feature film which i remember going to see at the cinema when it was originally released .
some of it has subtle messages about mj 's feeling towards the press and also the obvious message of drugs are bad m'kay .
visually impressive but of course this is all about michael jackson so unless you remotely like mj in anyway then you are going to hate this and find it boring .
